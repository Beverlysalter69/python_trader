	      <h2>Training the Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>

	      <p>
                With our features generated and scaled, we are now free to begin
                training different machine learning algorithms, and select
                which to use for our final predictor. It is here that we implement
                a fundamental, bad assumption: the trend in the closing stock
                price is only dependent on the features we have selected, and no other
                external factors. We make this assumption for simplicity, we are
                trying to predict trends, not be able to nail down the exact stock
                price after the third quarter earnings are announced, just before
                the yearly trade show for a company. It is more of a tool that could
                be used with that external model to make investing decisions.

              <p>
                There are two important things that fall out of making this assumption,
                in regards to training the algorithm. First, we are able to train
                on all of our quote data over the full time window. Ordinarily with 
                time series data, it is vital to train on the earliest data, and train
                on the latest data. With our assumption, this goes away, since past
                data is in the features we include, and we assume that information is
                all we need to determine future trends. Second, as we can train on
                the most recent data, we include the most recent data in the market, and
                don't have to worry that our data is trained on markets from 2-10 years
                in the past, which may behave very differently.
