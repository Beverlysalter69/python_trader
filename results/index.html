              <p>
                With the interpolation scheme set up, we are now able to predict
                the closing price for days between our rolling mean predictions, and
                compare the results with the actual closing price.
              </p>

              <p>
                We start by predicting the rolling means of four new stock quotes
                we did not train on, GE, KMB, MMM, and MU. These represent diversity
                in both industry and prices. We show a mixture of results in 
                Figures 1-5, for different stocks, timeframes, and rolling means.
                Note the individual scales in the left panel vary by plot, but 
                all of the fractional differences share the same scale.

                The results are mixed, there is clear noise in the predictions, and the
                magnitude of the effect is dependent on the magnitude of the closing price.
                We use the fractional difference for most of our error analysis, as the 
                price variation across 10 years will induce a bias. For example, if 10 years
                ago the price was $20 with variations on the scale of $1, that is larger swing
                than a $200 stock with a change of $1. An absolute variation of $1
                is significantly less of a return in the later case, hence the preference for
                the fractional change. Both are nonetheless good metrics.
              </p>

              <p>
                We show different metrics for the difference between the predicted rolling 
                means and true rolling means in Figure 6.
                The easiest to interpret is the standard deviation, where 1 standard deviation
                contains roughly 68% of the data. That means for MU at 30 days, 68% of the
                predictions fall roughly within a dollar of the true rolling mean. MMM by this
                point appears worse, with a 3 dollar difference. If we look at the standard
                deviation using percentage differences, for MU we see that this actually constitutes
                almost a 9% difference in price, which is a poor predictor, whereas for MMM
                this is only a 3% difference.

                  the x axis. What matters most is the percentage standard deviations,
                  as a large percent change leads to unreliable predictions.

                We use the rolling mean predictions and our interpolation scheme to predict
                daily values for our subset of test quotes.
                The fractional mean squared error is shown in Figure 7, averaged for each day
                over all predictions. We see for KBM and MMM, the fraction mean squared error 
                is quite good. Even thirty days out, the FMSE<0.03, considering the simplicity
                of our algorithm and poor assumptions, this is an excellent result. Even for
                GE, with a FMSE that increases more quickly after 15 days, we see a fair 
                value for FMSE. The behavior of the FMSE for MU is significantly worse, with the 
                error skyrocketing above the others to extremely high values.

                  While three stocks behave relatively well with low FMSE at all values,
                  MU shows rapidly increasing values with further out predictions.

              <p>
                We show the absolute standard deviation of the price in Figure 8. The
                standard deviation is the square root of the MSE. Here we see results that 
                are at first glance, contradictory to what we saw in Figure 6. The high
                fractional variation of mu but low standard deviation relative to other
                quotes is due to this stock having a lower closing price than the others.
                KMB and MMM however have higher relative prices, leading to lower fractional
                MSE, even with their higher standard deviations. It is vital to consider both 
                metrics when measuring the effectiveness of the ML algorithms.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>

              <p>
                In conclusion, we generates a machine learning algorithm, that predicts
                future changes in rolling means using traditional stock predictors and 
                indicators. We unfold the predicted rolling means to interpolate values
                between our predictions. Predictions of the values tested on independent 
                stock quotes demonstrate fairly good predictive power for some stocks, for
                short term predictions, but overall there is large variation that makes
                our algorithm unreliable for long term forecasting.
              </p>

              <p>
                While unreliable for forecasting, given the simplicity of the model and
                poor assumptions we intentionally made, and the the difficulty of predicting closing 
                stocks prices and their high volatility, I am very happy with the model performance.
                There is lots of room for the improvements, and this is a model I intend
                on updating with time.
