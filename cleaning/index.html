	      <h2>Data Selection and Cleaning</h2>
	      <p>
                The first step in any process is to have a look at 
                the data and clean any null or incomplete
                values. We obtained all our data from the the 
                <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/historical-quotes.aspx">
                NASDAQ historical quote page</a>. This provides 
                up to 10 years of historical data of stocks, including
                closing price, open price, daily high, daily low, and
                volume of stocks traded. Much of our analysis focuses on
                the close price and volume.

              <p>
                We gathered data from 32 different companies from a variety of
                industries. The variety of companies is important, as each
                may contain seasonal trends, and these may be seasonality by 
                industry. The company codes we used for our analysis was:
                AAPL, ACM, AMZN, AWK, AWR, BA, BAC, C, CAT, COP, CVX, DAL,
                DD, FARM, FDP, GNC, HES, IBM, MAS, MCD, MON, MSEX, MSFT, NFLX,
                SBUX, STRL, TGT, TSLA, UPS, XOM, XPO, and VMC. The selection was 
                somewhat arbitrary, but includes both high and low priced
                stocks, and a mixture of large and small companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, a check of all this data provides no null values.
                This makes the job easy, but we can't ignore the possibility there
                won't be null values in the future, especially given there are 
                times a company will be taken off the trading market. In those
                conditions we could interpolate the price of the stock between
                dates, however this is not an accurate representation of how 
                the stock would be viewed on the market. It is better to maintain
                the stock at the last closing price, rather than give it an 
                artificial value, and fill the volume with 0 during these times.
                We thus will want to forward fill over null values. Ordinarily 
                this is followed by a backfill in this kind of situation, but 
                those values would exist before any real data, and not included
                in the quote. These values should not exist, and it would be worth
                letting an error arise to alert us of the issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                With any null values filled, it is now important to consider 
                price splitting. This is when a company chooses to adjust the
                price of a stock, by changing the number of shares available.
                If there are 200 shares currently priced at $10 each (total $2000), 
                a company may choose to double the number of shares, so each share 
                becomes two, and the price is halved (400 shares x $5 = $2000 
                preserving the total value). We thus check for price jumps of 2:1,
                3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and more odd fractions (like 2:3), and modulate the
                prices and volume to match the ratio it split to, so everything is
                in terms of the most recent number of shares on the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                These steps were relatively straightforward and require very little 
                computation time, it can't get much easier for data cleaning than this.
                In the next section I will discuss the features I used.
