	      <h2>Feature Selection</h2>
	      <p>
                There are many features that are used in forecasting.
	      </p>

              <p>
                <b>Bollinger Bands</b>: These utilize the rolling means of
                the closing price of a stock. Using the closing price
                averages over N previous days, the Upper (Lower) Bollinger
                Band is given by the + (-) 2 sigma standard deviation around
                the mean. The price of a stock within this window is used to
                determine when to buy or sell.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Momentum</b>: The momentum of a stock is given by taking 
                the price at the current day, and subtracting off some
                day in the past.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Relative Strength Index</b>: This is an indicator that 
                is dependent on the average amount of positive returns in an 
                N day period, and the average negative return.
              </p>

              <p>
                We use each of these traditional forecasting features, using 
                different windows to track both long and short term trends.
                Windows range from 5 to 30 days for most features. We add
                a few additional features, outside of these three. We include
                the difference in high/low and close/open prices as a measure 
                of volatility. We also include two variables to track the time
                of year, for industries that have seasonal variations. Finally
                we include a log price, as variations in the price may be
                larger/smaller with more/less expensive stocks, and there are
                a wide range of prices.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, we generate our target variables. Our targets are
                the predicted rolling means, as the relative fraction of the 
                current rolling means. This is done to reduce the noise, as
                day by day prediction is impossible for stock prices, but
                predicting trends is within the bounds of reason.
