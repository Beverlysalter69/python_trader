	      <h2>Filling close values from rolling means</h2>

              <h3>Interpolation Scheme</h3>

              <p>
                We now have predictions for the rolling means, of days
                3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. As the quote are only for
                weekdays, this puts our predictions at a little over a month
                out. To generate predicted close values, we can use the knowledge of 
                the most recent close, the subsequent rolling mean, and the rolling
                means afterwards to estimate the closing price for every day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Starting with the first block, the concept is simple-between the
                closing value, and the predicted 3 day mean, we know what the
                average value must be between those days. We start by placing the middle 
                day in an N day window at the predicted mean value. Then from the low
                endpoint, we set the high endpoint so that (high+low)/2=mean of the
                chunk. With the low, high, and midpoint set, we use a cubic spline to
                interpolate the rest of the points. We later introduced a tuning parameter,
                designed to pull the endpoints closer to the weighted mean to smooth
                the curve, after finding the predictions had systematic jumps at the endpoints.
              </p>

              <p>
                This method provides a smooth curve, approximating the trend of the 
                prices with good accuracy. As a demonstration of this process, we plot 
                below in blue the actualy closing prices, and in red our interpolation
                scheme for the true rolling means (before the tuning parameter introduction).
                We by no means expect to match the day to day trends, but look to capture
                the underlying trend.

              <h3>Smothing Noisy Predictions</h3>

              <p>
                With the interpolation scheme up and running, we now would like to 
                implement it on the predicted rolling means. Unfortunately, we 
                require a few more steps before we can begin the interpolation.
                To see why, let's examine the output of our preditions. Figure 3
                shows the predicted 3 day rolling mean of the data, compared with the
                true 3 day rolling mean, for an arbitrary window of time. Without
                introducing any metrics, we can see the predictions (red) generally 
                match the true trends (blue).

                <br>
                If, however, we look at the 30 day mean, as in Figure 4, we see
                there is a huge contribution due to noise in the predicted 30 day mean.
                The noise is worst at the largest rolling mean, but becomes significant
                around the 10 day prediction. If we perform the interpolation using 
                these values, the noise will cause our predicted values to vary wildly.

              </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                To adjust for this, we can smooth the data, by taking a rolling mean
                over a number of previous days to smooth out the noise. While this
                constricts the number of days we can make predictions over, it greatly
                removes the uncertanty of the predictions.
              </p>

              <p>
                We introduce smoothing and shifting on the predicted rolling means,
                choosing parameters that minimize the standard deviation in the 
                fractional deviation, given by pred/true-1. We show some of the 
                new predictions in the below figures. The left panel is as in 
                Figures 3 and 4 above, with the white line indicating the close
                price, blue the true rolling mean, green the prediction from our
                Adaboost Regressor, and the Red our new prediction, after smoothing
                and shifting. The right panel is the difference between predictions
                and the true rolling mean, with the prediction's means and standard
                deviation on top, for both the Adaboost prediction and new adjusted
                predictions.

                As can be seen from Figures 5-7, this smooth and shift technique is a significant 
                improvement from the predictions themself. Applying this to the smoothed data will
                result in a much more accurate rolling mean prediction, and thus, a more accurate 
                predicted closing price.
              </p>


              <p>
                This does raise the issue of our furthest prediction falling short of our 30 
                day limit. We can still use the 30 day prediction on the endpoint-it will just
                be incorporated with a higher uncertainty.
