	      <h2>Feature Scaling</h2>
	      <p>
                It is always useful to visualize and explore the data
                before performing any modeling. We combine the exploration
                and data scaling in this section. Scaling is very important 
                for many machine learning algorithms, so we will scale all
                of our continuous variables. We focus the scaling analysis
                on the data we trained our models on, to avoid biasing test
                results.
              </p>

              <p>
                I focus in this section primarily on the distributions of the features,
                rather than correlation or scatter plots between trends. Quote information
                is incredibly noisy, and attempts at these lead to one of two things:
                either plots showing little to no correlation due to daily noise, or 
                apparent high correlation, as the market is always tending towards an
                overall increase, and all trends point this way. We will save examination
                of trends for the analysis section.

              <!-- diff_co -->
              <h3>diff_co</h3>

              <p>
                We will start with the percent difference between the closing and
                opening price for the day, denoted diff_co. We display the histogram 
                of this distribution in Figure 1. Examining a few cases, we see
                FDP is almost entirely contained within &plusmn 5%, whereas BA is
                spread to within a &plusmn 10% range.
              </p>

              <p>
                <br>
                With all these different distributions, it is useful to look at the
                combination of these distribution, as we do in Figure 2. We wind up with
                a normal distribution, with the bulk of the distribution falling within
                that &plusmn 5%.
              </p>

                <br>
                The distribution of all the diff_co values show a clear normal
                distribution. We perform a z-scaling on the normally distributed
                data, as seen in Figure 3. The scaling performed is a custom scheme,
                where we omit data points on the furthest extreme, and renormalize.
                This is repeated until the new fits perform minimal change in the 
                distribution.

              <!-- diff_hl -->
              <h3>diff_hl</h3>

              <p>
                Similar to the analysis we performed for the difference between
                close and opening prices, we generated a feature for the percent
                difference between daily high and lows, diff_hl. The distribution of 
                values is exclusively negative by design, and skewed towards higher
                diff_hl, as can be seen in Figure 4. We perform z-scaling
                on the diff_hl, as can be seen in Figure 5.

              <!-- momentum -->

              <p>
                The distribution of momentum, as with diff_co and diff_hl, varies greatly
                depending on the company. This can be seen in Figure 6, which shows the 
                3 day momentum of the percentage of the closing price (arguably the shortest 
                possible momentum measurement). 
              </p>

                  we see the cumulative distribution is normal in shape. For each momentum window, 
                  we use a different mean and standard deviation for the z-scaling.

              <!-- bollinger bands -->

              <h3>Bollinger Bands</h3>

              <p>
                The Bollinger Bands have a unique distribution. Figure 8 shows the distribution of
                the daily value relative to the 25 day mean bands. A value of 1 (-1) indicates the
                daily close is at the upper (lower) band. As can be seen, there is typically a double 
                peak in the distribution, with significant variation in the shape of those peaks.
              </p>

                  the positive 0.5 peak tends to be larger.

              <p>
                <br>
                Combining these distributions, we see our first significantly non-normal 
                distribution in Figure 9. We decide to use a unique scaling for the Bollinger
                Bands, with uniform treatment for all band windows we utilize. We z-scale using
                a mean of 0, and standard deviation of 0.65 across all bands we choose. This 
                was selected by calculating the standard deviation for the distribution, and modulating
                the scaling value so roughly 95% of the data was within 2 standard deviations.
                A non-traditional z-scaling, but more than sufficient to fill our scaling needs.

              <!-- RSI -->

              <p>
                The Relative Strength Index gives a measure of the total gains in the closing
                price, relative to the total losses in the closing price, over a window of time.
                The simple mathematical form of this is 
                <br>
                <br>
                RSI = 1 - 1 / ( 1 + A / B )
                <br>
                <br>
                Where A = average gains in window, and B = average losses in window. Due to the
                nature of this definition, there is a hard cutoff at 0 and 1, with values typically
                winding up around 0.5. We show a 15 day RSI in Figure 10 (typically 14 days is used).
              </p>


              <figure>
                <img src="/python_trader/images/exploration/rsi_15_short.jpg" 
                     alt="15 day RSI distribution">

                We combine the distributions in Figure 11, and the cumulative distribution almost 
                resembles a normal distribution.
                Like the Bollinger Bands, this requires a unique normalization. We could perform
                a min-max normalization, bringing the distribution from -1 to 1, but given the 
                shape of the distribution it seems appropriate to perform another custom z-scaling.
                Fitting 95% in two sigma, we use a mean of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.2 to
                z-scale all RSI features.

              <h3>Log Closing Price</h3>

              <p>
                Finally, we perform another custom normalization for the base 10 logarithm
                of the closing price. The closing price lies between $10 and $1000 for 
                almost all common stocks, and for everything in our distribution. This places
                the log between 1 and 3, so subtracting 1.5 puts most our log prices between
                -1 and 1. With this I play more loosely, as this will most likely serve as 
                a damping term, where more or less expensive prices lead to steeper or 
                flatter trends.
