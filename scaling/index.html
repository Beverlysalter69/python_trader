	      <h2>Feature Scaling</h2>
	      <p>
                It is always useful to visualize and explore the data
                before performing any modeling. We combine the exploration
                and data scaling in this section. Scaling is very important 
                for many machine learning algorithms, so we will scale all
                of our continuous variables.

              <!-- diff_co -->

              <p>
                We will start with the percent difference between the closing and
                opening price for the day, denoted diff_co. We display the histogram 
                of this distribution in Figure 1. Examining a few cases, we see
                FDP is almost entirely contained within &plusmn 5%, wheras BA is
                spread to within a &plusmn 10% range.

                  Figure 1 - Distribution of percent difference between the daily close 
                  and open prices for 15 of our samples. There are clear differences
                  in diff_co distribution for different stocks.

              <p>
                With all these different distributions, it is useful to look at the
                combination of these distribution, as we do in Figure 2. We wind up with
                a normal distribution, with the bulk of the distribution falling within
                that &plusmn 5%.
